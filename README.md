# Movies4U

## Project Overview
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying
a movie with friends and family. In this project, weâ€™ll design and implement an android application
to allow us to find the most popular movies playing.

This app uses the API from [episodate.com](https://www.episodate.com/api/)

## What I learned
- Fetch data from the Internet with episodate API
- Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views
- Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
- Build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system.
